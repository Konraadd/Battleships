# Battleships
A website with simulation of 2 bots playing classic game of battleships
# How to run
Download, build and compile the project, then run. Target framework used .NET 5.0.
# How it works
The website creates 2 bots with boards and automatically places ships on the board of each bot player. With each press of the "NEXT ROUND" button players make random shots at the opposing board. The game ends when one of the players shoots all the squares that are occupied by the opposing players battleships which is signalized by a pop-up message. As of now, draw is not implemented.
